A Port Scan Attack has been detected by SNORT.

SNORT will work on solving this issue. 

A Port Scan Attack involves systematically scanning a computer's ports. Since a port is a point of entry into a server or network, this type of attack is often used by attackers to find weaknesses in a system's defenses. It's one of the preliminary stages of an attack, allowing the attacker to map out what services are running and possibly vulnerable.

To mitigate a Port Scan Attack, consider the following steps:

1. Use a Firewall: Configuring a firewall to block unwanted traffic can prevent unauthorized access through open ports.

2. Regularly Update and Patch Systems: Keeping systems updated helps close off security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.

3. Monitor Network Traffic: Keeping an eye on your network traffic can help you identify unusual patterns or spikes that might indicate a scanning attempt.

4. Employ Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): These systems can detect unusual network traffic and alert you to potential scanning activities.

5. Limit Responses to Unknown Hosts: Configure your systems to limit the amount of information they reveal in response to unsolicited network requests.

Promptly addressing these vulnerabilities can significantly reduce the risk of a successful cyber attack.
