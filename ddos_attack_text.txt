A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack has been detected by SNORT. 

SNORT will work on solving this issue. 

A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. This is achieved by using multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. 

To mitigate a DDoS attack, consider the following steps:

1. Increase Bandwidth: Having more bandwidth than you typically need can help absorb the excess traffic.

2. Use DDoS Mitigation Tools: Employ tools or services that can recognize and filter out malicious traffic.

3. Distribute Your Network Resources: Spreading your resources across multiple data centers can help absorb and mitigate attack impact.

4. Create a Response Plan: Having a pre-defined action plan allows you to respond quickly to an attack.

5. Cooperate with Your ISP: Your Internet Service Provider might be able to offer assistance during an attack.

Remember, the key to effectively combating a DDoS attack is preparation and immediate action.
