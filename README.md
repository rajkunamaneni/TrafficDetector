**Authors: Georgy Zaets, Raj Kunamaneni, Guneet Mummaneni, Jared Pugh**

### Introduction
In the age of pervasive computer security threats, safeguarding networks against eavesdropping and snooping attacks is more crucial than ever. This repository aims to address the challenges faced by non-tech-savvy individuals who struggle to comprehend and employ traditional open-source network security tools. Our goal is to create an extensible network toolkit directory that is accessible to all users, providing a lightweight yet effective solution for detecting and mitigating eavesdropping attacks.
